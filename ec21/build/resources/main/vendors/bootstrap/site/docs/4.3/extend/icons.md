description: Guidance and suggestions for using external icon libraries with Bootstrap.

Bootstrap doesn't include an icon library by default, but we have a handful of recommendations for you to choose from. While most icon sets include multiple file formats, we prefer SVG implementations for their improved accessibility and vector support.

## Preferred

We've tested and used these icon sets ourselves.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
- [Iconic](https://github.com/iconic/open-iconic)
- [Octicons](https://octicons.github.com/)

## More options

While we haven't tried these out, they do look promising and provide multiple formats—including SVG.

- [Bytesize](https://github.com/danklammer/bytesize-icons)
- [Google Material icons](https://material.io/tools/icons/)
- [Ionicons](https://ionicons.com/)
- [Feather](https://feathericons.com/)
- [Dripicons](http://demo.amitjakhu.com/dripicons/)
- [Ikons](http://ikons.piotrkwiatkowski.co.uk/)
- [Glyph](https://glyph.smarticons.co/)
